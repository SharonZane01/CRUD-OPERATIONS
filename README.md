# CRUD-OPERATIONS


CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, and are the four basic functions of a database:
Create: Add new records to the database
Read: Retrieve data from the database
Update: Modify existing records in the database
Delete: Remove existing records from the database 
 
CRUD operations are fundamental to the functionality and interactivity of modern applications. For example, you perform CRUD operations when you sign up for a user account, visit your profile, or delete a post. 
 
CRUD can also refer to user interface conventions that allow users to view, search, and modify information using computer-based forms and reports.
